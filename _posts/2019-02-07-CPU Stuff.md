**Clock speed**

CPU clock speed - measured in GHz (Gigahertz). CPU is like a engine. Higher clock speed = compute calculations faster = faster processing.

**Multi-core / Multi-processors**

One core is a single processing unit. Multi core = multiple processing units each of same clock speed. Instead of increasing the clock speed on one core, adding another core also works.

**Multi-threading**

Multi-threading is the ability to utilize multiple cores for processing. Runs faster (like modern CPUs), huge performance increase.

If applications are single thread, they take up a whole core for themselves. So having multi cores here is also a good thing.

Hyper-threading is useful when apps are well optimized for multi-threading. Splits the core to share workload.

You can run multiple threads on one core. Systems with a single processor can implement multi threading by time slicing (done by OS)




**8-bit vs 32-bit vs 64-bit**

The first Gameboy was 8-bit ðŸ˜¦

32-bit and 64-bit are different types of processors. They refer to the width of the CPU Register (Processor Register) - quickly accessible location available for the CPU.

2^32 will be able to use 4GB RAM. Which means 2^64 is supposed to be able to support 17 billion GB RAM. But Windows is usually 16GB RAM due to licensing issues.

RAM - Random-Access Memory





Was watching the [Ultimate Game Boy talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyzD8pNlpwI) when I realize I should know some basics ðŸ˜…
