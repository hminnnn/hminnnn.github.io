The North Pole experience almost 6 months of darkness and then almost 6 months of brightness!!  

When the Northern Hemisphere is experiencing summer with longer daylight, the North Pole is in constant daylight and similarly the South Pole will be in constant darkness. This is because of the 23.5 degrees tilt of the Earth as it orbits around the sun.  

Is this a cool fact or am I easily amazed? ðŸ˜… I feel like Iâ€™ve heard this before but forgotten about it.

Is the North or South Pole colder?  

"North! Because polar bears have more fur than penguins" - M  
"Can I not be your friend anymore" - J  

Nope the South is colder! South has more land and is higher above the sea level. Antarctica is the highest continent. North sits on ice surrounded by waters and water warms the air. 

Penguins are native to the South. Polar Bears live in the North. I googled to find that they have never met ðŸ˜…
