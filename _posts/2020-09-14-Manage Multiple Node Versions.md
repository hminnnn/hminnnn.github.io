Install Node Version Manager! (nvm) 

This lets me manage multiple node versions in my comp. Download from here <https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows>

- Uninstall existing nodejs versions before installing the version manager.

- List all versions installed:  
  `nvm ls`

- Install the version you want:  
  `nvm install 10.15.3`

- Use the version you want:  
  `nvm use 10.15.3`

Ezzzzz.
