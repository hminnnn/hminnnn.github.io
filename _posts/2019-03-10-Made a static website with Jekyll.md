I wanted somewhere to note what I searched about on some days when a random question hits me.


(This usually happens when I get bored at work)  


I used to write them in my iPhone's notes but the information seems to get left in there, in my phone, and not in my head. And I somehow don't quite like to look back at it in my phone.


Or maybe I wanted to do something new. I just wanted to do something. I actually started 2 weekends ago(?) but I stopped halfway through the tutorial. It was easier than I expected. I  lost motivation a bit but now I'm done with the basic look and feel yay. I did it.
