How does the robot vacuum go back to dock on its own!?

Probably using Infrared sensors. The dock emits IR. Can't seem to find much about this. Pretty cool though.

Sensors:

- Cliff sensors (IR beams pointing downwards)

- Optical encoders: Light sensors to detect how many times the wheels rotated

- Cameras for new ones

- Collision sensors triggered by bumpers

IR beams bounces off the walls. Using receiver and emitter, it can tell whether it is near or far walls.

Probably born from studying insects. An ant doesn't have much brain power but it follows a set of rules like search for food and return to nest. Pretty similar to the robot vacuum.
